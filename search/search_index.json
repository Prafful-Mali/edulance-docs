It addresses the real-world problem of finding suitable teammates for technical projects by matching people based on their skills and project requirements. Problem Statement Students in colleges often struggle to find a good group of teammates within their class or campus. As a result, it becomes difficult for them to participate in hackathons or group projects at a competitive level. Proposed Solution Create project posts with clear details such as title, description, people required, and required skills. Join or apply to open posts that match their interests and expertise. Collaborate effectively with others to build meaningful projects and gain real-world experience. Target Audience Students participating in hackathons or college projects. Independent developers looking to collaborate on side projects. Early-stage entrepreneurs seeking technical collaborators. Business Impact Metric Impact User Engagement Encourages collaboration by increasing interactions and participation in projects. Skill Development Helps users enhance their technical and teamwork skills through real-world collaboration. Scalability Can evolve into a community-driven platform with project recommendations, leaderboards, and achievements.","title":"Business Use Case \u2014 Edulance"},{"location":"#business-use-case-edulance","text":"","title":"Business Use Case \u2014 Edulance"},{"location":"#project-purpose","text":"Edulance provides an online space for students, developers, and creators to connect and collaborate on group projects or hackathons .

The platform enables users to create or join hackathons and group projects. Each user can securely log in, post collaboration opportunities, and find teammates based on relevant skills and project requirements. Core Features Authentication If a user is not registered, they can create an account by providing a username , email , and password . After registration, a verification email is sent to the provided email address. Once the user verifies their email, the account becomes active, allowing them to access the platform. If the user is already registered, they can log in using their credentials. Upon successful authentication, they are redirected to the Home Page . If the credentials are invalid, an error message prompts them to re-enter their information. Authorization Authorization in Edulance is role-based, granting different permissions to Admins and Users . Admin Capabilities Can add or remove any user Can add, remove, or update skills Can update or delete any post User Capabilities Can create, update, or delete their own posts Can join available posts created by others Can view applicants for their posts Can connect with other users via email Data Flow Diagram In Scope Account Management: Users can register and log in. Authentication and Authorization: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control (Admin and User roles). Post Creation and Management: Users can create, update, and delete posts for hackathons or group projects, specifying the number of required participants, description, required skills, and application deadline. Skill Tagging: Posts can include specific skills to attract suitable applicants. Application System: Authenticated users can apply to open posts before the application deadline. Admin Management: Admins can manage users, posts, and skills. Progressive Web App (PWA): The platform will be developed as a Progressive Web App to provide an app-like experience, offline access, and better performance on all devices Out of Scope Forgot Password feature Rejecting or approving applications (no status tracking) Sending direct messages or notifications between users Commenting or asking questions on posts Team creation and management after application acceptance Requirements Functional Requirements User Authentication: Users should be able to register, log in, and authenticate using JWT tokens. Email Verification: Upon registration, users must verify their email before accessing the platform. Role-Based Access: Admins have elevated permissions to manage users, skills, and posts. Post Creation: Authenticated users can create posts for hackathons or group projects. Application Submission: Authenticated users can apply to open posts before deadlines. Deadline Validation: The system should automatically prevent applications after the last date. Technical Requirements Backend Framework: Django(5.2.8) with Django REST Framework(3.16.1) for REST APIs Language: Python(3.12) Authentication: JWT-based authentication with email verification Email Verification: Implemented via Django\u2019s email backend to send verification links to users during registration Database: PostgreSQL(14.19) Validation: Model and serializer-level input validation Testing: Pytest(9.0.0) for backend testing Environment Management: uv for virtual environment and dependency management Deployment: Docker support with environment configuration files ( .env ) Frontend Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript Framework: Bootstrap Schema Diagram Architecture Diagram","title":"Edulance"},{"location":"functional/#edulance","text":"","title":"Edulance"},{"location":"functional/#overview","text":"This document outlines the key features, requirements, and data flow of Edulance .

Validate the platform\u2019s API and frontend behavior. Scope covers functional testing, basic UI testing, and role-based access validation. Test Strategy Functional Testing: Verify each feature against acceptance criteria. API Testing (DRF): Validate all endpoints using valid/invalid inputs. UI Testing: Confirm correct rendering, validation messages, and error handling. Role-Based Testing: Validate permissions for normal users and admin users. Regression Testing: Execute after major changes to ensure stability. Test Coverage Goals Authentication (login, logout, restricted pages) User profiles (view/update) Skills & categories (create/edit/delete by admin) Post & collaboration Global search (Post) Access control rules Error handling and validation messages Execution Plan Identify core modules and prepare test scenarios. Begin with API testing, then UI testing. Execute tests in the staging environment before deployment. Track defects, validate fixes, and re-test. Perform a final round of regression before release. Roles & Responsibilities Tester: Execute test cases, document defects, perform regression testing. Developer: Fix issues, support with clarifications, and implement enhancements. Project Lead: Approve test plans, ensure resources, monitor progress. Admin/DevOps (optional): Manage staging environments and deployments. Entry & Exit Criteria Entry Criteria All required features are developed and deployed to staging. APIs are stable and accessible. Test data is prepared for users, skills, and Post. Exit Criteria All critical and major defects are resolved. Regression testing is complete with no blockers. System is stable for production deployment. Risks & Mitigation Risks Incomplete feature development may delay testing. API instability can block UI testing. Limited test data can affect test coverage. Changing requirements may cause rework. Mitigation Early coordination with developers for feature readiness. Maintain stable staging environments. Prepare reusable test data sets. Regular sync-ups to handle requirement changes early.","title":"Test Plan \u2013 Edulance Platform"},{"location":"test_planning/#test-plan-edulance-platform","text":"","title":"Test Plan \u2013 Edulance Platform"},{"location":"test_planning/#objective-scope","text":"Ensure all core functionalities of the Edulance platform (authentication, user profiles, skills, Post, and search) work as intended.
